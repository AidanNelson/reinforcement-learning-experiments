# reinforcement-learning-experiments
A growing collection of reinforcement learning examples built in javascript.


[Some tensorflow.js implementations](./simple-rl-tutorials) of Arthur Juliani's reinforcement learning / q learning [tutorials](https://medium.com/emergent-future/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0).


[A mostly non-functional mashup](./flappy-bird-policy-network) of Dan Shiffman's [Flappy Bird Clone](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Flappy-Bird-Clone) with the policy-gradient reinforcement learning code found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/cart-pole).
